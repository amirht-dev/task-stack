3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory and add your Appwrite credentials and OAuth keys:

    ```bash

    NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_NAME = '<appwrite project name>'
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_HOSTNAME = '<appwrite project hostname>'
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT = '<appwrite project endpoint>'

    NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY = '<appwrite project api key with auth and database.rows.read and database.rows.write scopes>'

    NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID = '<appwrite project database id>'
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_WORKSPACES_ID = '<appwrite project database workspaces table id>'
